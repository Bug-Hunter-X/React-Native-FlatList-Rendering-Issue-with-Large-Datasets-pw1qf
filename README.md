# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's `FlatList` component when dealing with extensive datasets.  The bug showcases incorrect rendering of list items when rapidly scrolling, causing blank spaces or inaccurate data presentation. The solution focuses on optimizing the `renderItem` function and data processing to enhance rendering efficiency.

## Bug Description

The `FlatList` component fails to render items accurately during fast scrolling, resulting in visual glitches within the list. This problem arises from inefficient handling of data updates and the rendering process within the `renderItem` method.

## Solution

The solution incorporates techniques to streamline data handling and rendering optimizations to solve the rendering issue. These include:

* **Efficient Data Processing:** Minimizing computations within `renderItem` improves performance by reducing the load on the UI thread.
* **Component Memoization:** Utilizing `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of list items.
* **Key Extraction:** Assigning unique `key` props to list items for better performance during updates.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the application: `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
5. Scroll quickly through the list to observe the bug.
6. Apply the solution in `bugSolution.js` to fix the rendering issue.
