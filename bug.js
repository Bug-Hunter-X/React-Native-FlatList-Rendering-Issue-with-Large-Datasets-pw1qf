This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that when scrolling quickly, some items in the list may not render correctly, resulting in blank spaces or incorrect data being displayed. This is often due to inefficient data handling or improper optimization within the `renderItem` function.
